fix cfd3 all couple/cfd/convectiveImpl integrateHeatEqn false 

[Description:]

This fix is responsible for the coupling heat between CFD and DEM calculation, i.e. for pushing and pulling of per-particle properties that are necessary to calculate the interphase heat flux.

In simplest setting, the heat flux is coupled in an explicit way (couple/cfd/convection). However, the user can use the optional 'couple/cfd/convectiveImpl' fix that will make the heat transfer coefficient and the fluid temperature available to LIGGGHTS. This can be used to perform any user-defined update of the particle temperature.

The following property/atom quantities are generated by the 'couple/cfd/convection' fix: (i) "Temp", i.e., the particle temperature, including a scalar transport equation that will update this quantity based on the calculated heat flux, and (ii) "convectiveHeatFlux" (or "radiativeHeatFlux") that is that from the fluid. The fix 'couple/cfd/convectiveImpl' generates the "heatFluid" and "heatTransCoeff" properties. Note: 'couple/cfd/convectiveImpl' requires that the per-particle quantity "Temp" is already available.
