scalarTransportModel_generalManual command :h3

[Syntax:]

Defined in scalarTransportProperties dictionary.

scalarTransportModel generalManual;

generalManualProps
\{
    phiFieldName {phiName};
    voidfractionFieldName {voidfractionName};
    ScT {scalar1};
    PrT {scalar2};
    cpVolumetric {scalar3};

{phiName} = (optional) name of the surface field for the SUPERFICIAL flux, default "phi". :ulb,l
{voidfractionName} = (optional) name of the finite volume voidfraction field, default "voidfraction". :l
{scalar1} = (optional, default 0.7) turbulent Schmidt Nr, set to large value to suppress turbulent species transport :l
{scalar2} = (optional, default 0.7) turbulent Prandtl Nr, set to large value to suppress turbulent heat transport :l
{scalar3} = (optional, alternatively define word1) volumetric heat capacity as a global constant (in contrast to cpVolumetricFieldName for a field). This is the mixture density times the heat capacity [J/K/(m_voidspace)^3], will only be used if cpVolumetricFieldName, or updateMixtureProperties = false :l
{word1} = (optional, alternatively define scalar3) volumetric heat capacity as a field :l
{word3} = mixture density field :l
{C} = concentration field name. Can be multiple, just use a new line for each :l
{T} = temperature field name :l
{C}_normalizeFieldID = optional line to trigger algebraic calculation of a field based on another
{fieldID} = id of the field (as per the list 'eulerianFields') that is used for the algebraic calculation
{factor} after {C}_normalizeValue = optional factor for the algebraic calculation
:ule

[Examples:]

generalManualProps
\{
    phiFieldName "phi";
    ScT 0.7;
    PrT 0.7;
    cpVolumetric 1196;
    rhoMixFieldName "rhoMix";
    eulerianFields
    (
        C
        T
    ); :pre

    fvOptionsC
    \{
    \}; :pre
    fvOptionsT
    \{
    \}; :pre

\} :pre

[Description:]

Solves the advection-dispersion transport equation for a dilute scalar quantity in the fluid phase. fvOptions can be specified to model sources, etc. in the fluid phase. Exchange models with a particle phase can be included by including appropriate forceModels in couplingProperties.

The user can decide to NOT solve the transport equation for a certain species but simply copy and scale from another field by using the {C}_normalizeFieldID and {C}_normalizeValue keywords. 

[Restrictions:]
The user MUST ensure the "phi" field is SUPERFICIAL (i.e., the fluid-phase velocity times voidfraction interpolatedat the cells' faces). The code cannot know or check whether this is the case, so the user of a certain solver has to ensure this. 


[Related commands:]

none.
