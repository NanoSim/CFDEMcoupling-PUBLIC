{phiName} = (optional) name of the surface field for the SUPERFICIAL flux, default "phi". :ulb,l
{voidfractionName} = (optional) name of the finite volume voidfraction field, default "voidfraction". :l
{scalar1} = (optional, default 0.7) turbulent Schmidt Nr, set to large value to suppress turbulent species transport :l
{scalar2} = (optional, default 0.7) turbulent Prandtl Nr, set to large value to suppress turbulent heat transport :l
{scalar3} = (optional, alternatively define word1) volumetric heat capacity as a global constant (in contrast to cpVolumetricFieldName for a field). This is the mixture density times the heat capacity [J/K/(m_voidspace)^3], will only be used if cpVolumetricFieldName, or updateMixtureProperties = false :l
{word1} = (optional, alternatively define scalar3) volumetric heat capacity as a field :l
{word3} = mixture density field :l
{C} = concentration field name. Can be multiple, just use a new line for each :l
{T} = temperature field name :l
{C}_normalizeFieldID = optional line to trigger algebraic calculation of a field based on another
{fieldID} = id of the field (as per the list 'eulerianFields') that is used for the algebraic calculation
{factor} after {C}_normalizeValue = optional factor for the algebraic calculation

{fieldName} = the name of the reaction rate field that is saved to disk (optional)
{dimensionedRateConstant} = reaction rate constant. must ALWAYS have inverse time units, since concentration is dimensionless
{reactant....} = list of names of the reactants. Make list empty to switch off reaction calculations
{exponentReactant...} = list of exponents for each reactant concentration. Must have same length as {reactant....} 
{stoichiometricFactorReactant...} = list of stoichiometric factors for each reactant. Must have same length as {reactant....}

[Description:]

Solves the advection-dispersion transport equation for a dilute scalar quantity in the fluid phase. fvOptions can be specified to model sources, etc. in the fluid phase. Exchange models with a particle phase can be included by including appropriate forceModels in couplingProperties.

The user can decide to NOT solve the transport equation for a certain species but simply copy and scale from another field by using the {C}_normalizeFieldID and {C}_normalizeValue keywords. 

[Restrictions:]
The user MUST ensure the "phi" field is SUPERFICIAL (i.e., the fluid-phase velocity times voidfraction interpolatedat the cells' faces). The code cannot know or check whether this is the case, so the user of a certain solver has to ensure this. 


[Related commands:]

none.
